# The-Spark-Foundation-Tasks
Includes tasks completed during the data-science internship at The Spark Foundation.

## Tasks  

Here, are the links to the implemented tasks:  

* [**Task 1**](./Task1/)  
> It is a basic level implementation of a **supervised machine learning** model trained on Linear Regrassion.  
> Here the objective is to predict the marks that a student can score, provided number of houres he/she studies.  
> To access the python notebook, visit [here](./Task1/task1.ipynb).  

* [**Task 2**](./Task2/)  
> It is a basic level implementation of an **usupervised machine learning** model using KMeans Clustering.  
> Here the objective is to predict the optimal clusters for _Iris_ dataset.  
> To access the python notebook, visit [here](Task2/task2.ipynb).

_These tasks were done as the internship projects._
